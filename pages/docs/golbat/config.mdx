# Golbat Configuration

This documentation outlines all available configuration keys for Golbat. It is important to note that the presence of a configuration key does not necessitate its specification in your `config.toml` file. The advised approach is to start with the standard configuration file from the repository. Only append additional keys to this base file if there is a need to alter Golbat's default operational parameters.
