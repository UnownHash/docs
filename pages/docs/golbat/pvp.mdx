# PvP Calculation

The Player vs. Player (PvP) calculation that Golbat uses is powered by [Gohbem](https://github.com/UnownHash/gohbem). This library was rewritten in Go by [lenisko](https://github.com/lenisko) from the original NodeJS [Mygod/ohbem](https://github.com/Mygod/ohbem) project.

If there are errors or feature enhancements around PvP calculation, they must be addressed in this library before being added to Golbat. This library is mostly a background artifact unless Niantic releases a new PvP league or modifies level caps. There are a few outstanding feature enhancements, but the core project functions as intended.
