# PvP Calculation

The Player vs. Player (PvP) calculation that Golbat uses is powered by [Gohbem](https://github.com/UnownHash/gohbem). This library was rewritten in Go by [lenisko](https://github.com/lenisko) from the original nodejs [Mygod/ohbem](https://github.com/Mygod/ohbem) project.

If there are errors or feature enhancements around PvP calculation then it needs to be addressed in this library prior to being added to Golbat. Unless Niantic releases a new PvP league or modifies level caps this library is mostly a background artifact. There a few outstanding feature enhancements but the core project is functioning as intended.
