# [Golbat](https://github.com/UnownHash/Golbat)

**Golbat** is our data processor. It's job is to accept HTTP requests, format it into something useful, save it to your database, and then send webhooks to external services. It does the heavy processing, and is good at it. We have optimized it over some time over some big instances.

Currently **Golbat** is our most feature complete service and should be safe to start testing if you wish.
