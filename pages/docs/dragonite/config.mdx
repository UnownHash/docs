```

| Key | Default | Description |
| :-- | :-- | :-- |
| `url` | "http://ip:port" | The URL for your Koji service. |
| `bearer_token` | "KOJI_SECRET" | When Koji secret (`KOJI_SECRET`) configuration is enabled you must pass a secure token so Dragonite is able to communicate. |

## Prometheus section

```toml
#[prometheus]
#enabled = true
```

| :-- | :-- | :-- |

## Tunning section

| `dynamic_route_split` | true | When enabled Dragonite will update the route that workers are using as they connect or disconnect from an area. |

| `location_delay` | 0 | This value, in milliseconds, will add a slight wait period while a worker is moving to a new location. Adding a slight delay has proven to decrease empty GMO results and positively impact scans overall. Recommend starting with 100, 200, 300, etc and monitoring overall results. |
