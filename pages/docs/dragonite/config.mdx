</Callout>

## General section

```toml
[general]
login_delay = 0  #As of now there is no known login limit, this might change in the future.
...
```

| Key | Default | Description |
| :-- | :-- | :-- |
| `login_delay` | 0 | Seconds to sleep in-between PTC authenticating with one proxy. For "unlimited" proxies we recommend setting this value to 0 or 1. |
| `stats` | false | Whether raw worker stats are written to the Dragonite database. |
| `api_host` | 127.0.0.1 | Host listener address for Dragonite API. |
| `api_port` | 7272 | Host port address for Dragonite API. |

## Koji section

```toml
[koji]
url = "http://ip:port"
bearer_token = "KOJI_SECRET"
```

| Key | Default | Description |
| :-- | :-- | :-- |
| `url` | "http://ip:port" | The URL for your Koji service. |
| `bearer_token` | "KOJI_SECRET" | When Koji secret (`KOJI_SECRET`) configuration is enabled you must pass a secure token so Dragonite is able to communicate. |

## Prometheus section

```toml
#[prometheus]
#enabled = true
```

| Key | Default | Description |
| :-- | :-- | :-- |
| `enabled` | true | Uncomment and enable this value to turn on the prometheus endpoint within Dragonite. |

## Tunning section

```toml
[tuning]
#recycle_gmo_limit = 4900
#recycle_encounter_limit = 9900
#recycle_on_jail=false
#minimum_account_reuse_hours = 169
#location_delay = 0
#fort_location_delay = 0
```

| Key | Default | Description |
| :-- | :-- | :-- |
| `recycle_gmo_limit` | 4900 | (Advanced) Recommend keeping this value commented out. When the GMO limit is reached for a specific account it will be be rotated. |
| `recycle_encounter_limit` | 9900 | (Advanced) Recommend keeping this value commented out. When an account has encountered this amount of pokemon it will be rotated. |
| `recycle_on_jail` | false | Enabling this setting will utilize significantly more accounts. Currently five accounts are assigned to one worker and will rotate while the worker is running. |
| `location_delay` | 0 | This value, in milliseconds, will add a slight wait period while a worker is moving to a new location. Adding a slight delay has proven to decrease empty GMO results and positively impact scans overall. Recommend starting with 100, 200, 300, etc and monitoring overall results. |
| `fort_location_delay` | 0 | This value, in milliseconds, is the same as `location_delay` however it only impacts fort scans (gyms/pokestops). |
| `minimum_account_reuse_hours` | 0 | This sets the amount of hours for accounts to "rest" until they can be reused. Recommended value is 169 hours (7 days). |

## Rotom section

```toml
[rotom]
endpoint = "ws://127.0.0.1:7071"
#secret = ""
```

| Key | Default | Description |
| :-- | :-- | :-- |
| `endpoint` | "ws://127.0.0.1:7071" | This is the URL for your Rotom service. |
| `secret` | "" | When Rotom secret configuration is enabled you must pass a secure token so Dragonite is able to communicate. |

## Logging section

```toml
[logging]
save = true
#debug = false
#max_size = 500 # MB
#max_age = 30 # days
```

| Key | Default | Description |
| :-- | :-- | :-- |
| `save` | true | When enabled Dragonite will write log files to disk. |
| `debug` | false | When enabled Dragonite will write debug logging, which is very "chatty" and not required for general usage. |
