# Dragonite Configuration

<Callout type="info" emoji="ðŸš§">
    This page is still under construction
</Callout>

## General section

```toml
[general]
api_host = 127.0.0.1
api_port = 7272 
stats = true  #Enabled by default to write worker stats.
...
```

| Key | Default | Description |
| :-- | :-- | :-- |
| `api_host` | 127.0.0.1 | Host listener address for Dragonite API. |
| `api_port` | 7272 | Host port address for Dragonite API. |
| instance_name | "" | Display name of the instance in the admin instance selection |
| `stats` | true | Whether raw worker stats are written to the Dragonite database. |

## Auth provider section

Auth provider config sections look like `[auth.<provider>]` where `<provider>` can be ptc or nk. One or both may exist and be enabled. 
At least one section does need to exist with an 'enable = true' entry. 
Without this, the deprecated config locations under general and tuning will be used with both providers enabled.

```toml
[auth.ptc]
# enable this provider (defaults to false)
enable = true
# The following 2 options allow control over whether a certain provider
# should be used for leveling and/or scanning. Setting both to false allows
# one to do background token work without yet logging into the game with them.
# enable this provider for normal scanning
# enable_scanning = true (defaults to true)
# enable this provider for leveling
# enable_leveling = true (defaults to true)

# seconds to sleep in-between authing on one proxy
# login_delay = 20 (defaults to 20 for both providers)

# use swirlix/xilriws to remote auth PTC logins
# remote_auth_url = 
# background initer to collect tokens of accounts without using them - this is false by default
# token_init_enabled = true
# don't rely on remote auth and only use accounts with stored token - true by default
# token_refresh_only = true
```

âš  Additional config variables, but only put them if you know what you do âš 
| Key | Default | Description |
| :-- | :-- | :-- |
| token_refresh_concurrency | 10 | define concurrency for the token background refresher |
| token_init_concurrency | 1 | define concurrency for the token background initer |
| token_init_interval_seconds | PTC: 1, NK: 180 | define the interval to request tokens |

## Koji section

```toml
[koji]
url = "http://ip:port"
bearer_token = "KOJI_SECRET"
```

| Key | Default | Description |
| :-- | :-- | :-- |
| `url` | "http://ip:port" | The URL for your Koji service. |
| `bearer_token` | "KOJI_SECRET" | When Koji secret (`KOJI_SECRET`) configuration is enabled you must pass a secure token so Dragonite is able to communicate. |

## Prometheus section

```toml
#[prometheus]
#enabled = true
```

| Key | Default | Description |
| :-- | :-- | :-- |
| `enabled` | true | Uncomment and enable this value to turn on the prometheus endpoint within Dragonite. |

## Tunning section

```toml
[tuning]
#recycle_gmo_limit = 4900
#recycle_encounter_limit = 9900
#recycle_on_jail=false
#minimum_account_reuse_hours = 169
#location_delay = 0
#fort_location_delay = 0
```

| Key | Default | Description |
| :-- | :-- | :-- |
| `recycle_gmo_limit` | 4900 | (Advanced) Recommend keeping this value commented out. When the GMO limit is reached for a specific account it will be be rotated. |
| `recycle_encounter_limit` | 9900 | (Advanced) Recommend keeping this value commented out. When an account has encountered this amount of pokemon it will be rotated. |
| `recycle_on_jail` | false | Enabling this setting will utilize significantly more accounts. Currently five accounts are assigned to one worker and will rotate while the worker is running. |
| `location_delay` | 0 | This value, in milliseconds, will add a slight wait period while a worker is moving to a new location. Adding a slight delay has proven to decrease empty GMO results and positively impact scans overall. Recommend starting with 100, 200, 300, etc and monitoring overall results. |
| `fort_location_delay` | 0 | This value, in milliseconds, is the same as `location_delay` however it only impacts fort scans (gyms/pokestops). |
| `minimum_account_reuse_hours` | 0 | This sets the amount of hours for accounts to "rest" until they can be reused. Recommended value is 169 hours (7 days). |

## Accounts section

```toml
#[accounts]
#required_level = 31
#leveling_level = 31
```

| Key | Default | Description |
| :-- | :-- | :-- |
| `required_level` | 30 | Minimum account level required to be used for scanning/questing. This only accepts level 30-40. |
| `leveling_level` | 30 | Maximum level an account should reach during the leveling process. This only accepts level 30-32. |

## Rotom section

```toml
[rotom]
endpoint = "ws://127.0.0.1:7071"
#secret = ""
```

| Key | Default | Description |
| :-- | :-- | :-- |
| `endpoint` | "ws://127.0.0.1:7071" | This is the URL for your Rotom service. |
| `secret` | "" | When Rotom secret configuration is enabled you must pass a secure token so Dragonite is able to communicate. |

## Logging section

```toml
[logging]
save = true
#debug = false
#max_size = 500 # MB
#max_age = 30 # days
```

| Key | Default | Description |
| :-- | :-- | :-- |
| `save` | true | When enabled Dragonite will write log files to disk. |
| `debug` | false | When enabled Dragonite will write debug logging, which is very "chatty" and not required for general usage. |
| `max_size` | 500 | Max size that Dragonite will allow log files to grow before being deleted. |
| `max_age` | 30 | Time that logs will live on disk in days before Dragonite deletes the log file. |

## Processors section
