# Dragonite Configuration

<Callout type="info" emoji="🚧">
    This page is still under construction
</Callout>

## General section

```toml
[general]
api_host = 127.0.0.1
api_port = 7272 
stats = true  #Enabled by default to write worker stats.
...
```

| Key | Default | Description |
| :-- | :-- | :-- |
| `api_host` | 127.0.0.1 | Host listener address for Dragonite API. |
| `api_port` | 7272 | Host port address for Dragonite API. |
| `instance_name` | "" | Display name of the instance in the admin instance selection |
| `stats` | true | Whether raw worker stats are written to the Dragonite database. |

## Auth provider section

Auth provider config sections look like `[auth.<provider>]` where `<provider>` can be ptc or nk. One or both may exist and be enabled. 
At least one section does need to exist with an 'enable = true' entry. 
Without this, the deprecated config locations under general and tuning will be used with both providers enabled.

```toml
[auth.ptc]
# enable this provider (defaults to false)
enable = true
# The following 2 options allow control over whether a certain provider
# should be used for leveling and/or scanning. Setting both to false allows
# one to do background token work without yet logging into the game with them.
# enable this provider for normal scanning
# enable_scanning = true (defaults to true)
# enable this provider for leveling
# enable_leveling = true (defaults to true)

# seconds to sleep in-between authing on one proxy
# login_delay = 20 (defaults to 20 for both providers)

# use swirlix/xilriws to remote auth PTC logins
# remote_auth_url = 
# background initer to collect tokens of accounts without using them - this is false by default
# token_init_enabled = true
# don't rely on remote auth and only use accounts with stored token - true by default
# token_refresh_only = true
```

⚠ Additional config variables, but only put them if you know what you do ⚠
| Key | Default | Description |
| :-- | :-- | :-- |
| token_refresh_concurrency | 10 | define concurrency for the token background refresher |
| token_init_concurrency | 1 | define concurrency for the token background initer |
| token_init_interval_seconds | PTC: 1, NK: 180 | define the interval to request tokens |
| remote_auth_timeout_seconds | "" | define a timeout for remote auth requests |
| remote_init_retry_delay_minutes | "" | define a delay for retrying remote auth requests |
| token_init_start_delay_minutes | "" | define a delay for starting the token initer |
| token_refresh_days | "" | define the days after which a token should be refreshed |
| token_refresh_start_delay_minutes | "" | define a delay for starting the token refresher |
| ip_ban_backoff_minutes | 15 | define how to long to backoff an IP |
| remote_auth_secret | "" | define a secret for remote auth requests if needed |
| token_valid_days | "" | define the days a token is valid |

## Koji section

```toml
[koji]
url = "http://ip:port"
bearer_token = "KOJI_SECRET"
```

| Key | Default | Description |
| :-- | :-- | :-- |
| `url` | "http://ip:port" | The URL for your Koji service. |
| `bearer_token` | "KOJI_SECRET" | When Koji secret (`KOJI_SECRET`) configuration is enabled you must pass a secure token so Dragonite is able to communicate. |

## Prometheus section

```toml
#[prometheus]
#enabled = true
```

| Key | Default | Description |
| :-- | :-- | :-- |
| `enabled` | true | Uncomment and enable this value to turn on the prometheus endpoint within Dragonite. |

## Tunning section

```toml
[tuning]
#recycle_gmo_limit = 4900
#recycle_encounter_limit = 9900
#recycle_invasion_limit = 940
#recycle_on_jail=false
#minimum_account_reuse_hours = 169
#location_delay = 0
#fort_location_delay = 0
#scout_age_limit = 30
```

| Key | Default | Description |
| :-- | :-- | :-- |
| `recycle_gmo_limit` | 4900 | (Advanced) Recommend keeping this value commented out. When the GMO limit is reached for a specific account it will be be rotated. |
| `recycle_encounter_limit` | 9900 | (Advanced) Recommend keeping this value commented out. When an account has encountered this amount of pokemon it will be rotated. |
| `recycle_invasion_limit` | 940 | (Advanced) Recommend keeping this value commented out. When an account has encountered this amount of invasions it will be rotated. |
| `recycle_on_jail` | false | Enabling this setting will utilize significantly more accounts. Currently five accounts are assigned to one worker and will rotate while the worker is running. |
| `location_delay` | 0 | This value, in milliseconds, will add a slight wait period while a worker is moving to a new location. Adding a slight delay has proven to decrease empty GMO results and positively impact scans overall. Recommend starting with 100, 200, 300, etc and monitoring overall results. |
| `fort_location_delay` | 0 | This value, in milliseconds, is the same as `location_delay` however it only impacts fort scans (gyms/pokestops). |
| `minimum_account_reuse_hours` | 0 | This sets the amount of hours for accounts to "rest" until they can be reused. Recommended value is 169 hours (7 days). |
| `scout_age_limit` | 30 | |

```toml
# Make location_delay(max) dynamic by tuning against initial_gmo_success_rate(percentage), limited by minimum_location_delay(min).
initial_gmo_success_rate = 75
minimum_location_delay = 4000

# Introduced in 1.10.9 Testing. Automatically test accounts for being shadow banned and marked as banned in database.
test_shadow_banned=true

# Introduced in Dragonite 1.12.3-testing
# This option for questing will hold on to AR Quests and try to move to 'ar only scans' over time.
# This may become default later (the current default is 'true' which means it will try and drop ar quests if you have them as required, unless your account is marked as ar banned)
quest_layer_swap = false
```

## Accounts section

```toml
#[accounts]
#required_level = 31
#leveling_level = 31
```

| Key | Default | Description |
| :-- | :-- | :-- |
| `required_level` | 30 | Minimum account level required to be used for scanning/questing. This only accepts level 30-40. |

| `endpoint` | "ws://127.0.0.1:7071" | This is the URL for your Rotom service. |
| `secret` | "" | When Rotom secret configuration is enabled you must pass a secure token so Dragonite is able to communicate. |

## Logging section

```toml
[logging]
save = true
#debug = false
#max_size = 500 # MB
#max_age = 30 # days
```

| Key | Default | Description |
| :-- | :-- | :-- |
