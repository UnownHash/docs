# Rotom

[**Rotom**](https://github.com/UnownHash/Rotom/) is our device controller. When a MITM client connects to Rotom it will be registered as a device. Devices can register 1 to many workers. A 1 to 1 relationship of device to worker is also completely valid. The connected devices create a pool of workers that can process events. How many workers are available is dependent on your MITM provider, your device constraints and the configuration you provide within your MITM tool.

You can think of Rotom as a task scheduler, Rotom will pull jobs that need to be processed from Dragonite (backend controller) and will send those request to various workers depending on time, available capacity, and configuration.

Rotom communicates via websockets (`ws://`) to devices and Dragonite. This communication strategy allows for a smarter feedback loop between the backend server and actual worker.
