This guide walks you through what to do after you have completed the Docker or Standard setup process. You have things running but now what?

## Configure Koji

I know you want me to go setup _yet another_ thing but this is important as Koji helps you visualize and create routes. This will save time down the road. Go check out the [Koji Docs](https://koji.vercel.app).

Now that you have configured the service go modify your **Golbat** and **Flygon** config files.

## Modify MITM client

Point your MITM clients to `http://YOUR_IP:9002/` (assuming default port).

  same URI should be used for both Backend & Data Endpoint.
