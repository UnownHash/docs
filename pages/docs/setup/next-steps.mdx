# Next Steps

This guide walks you through what to do after you have completed the Docker or Standard setup process. You have things running but now what?

## Setup RDM Raw Reflection

The [Hybrid Setup](/docs/other/hybrid-setup) will allow you to continue using RealDeviceMap (RDM) to control your devices while sending data to Golbat for processing.

## Configure Koji

I know you want me to go setup _yet another_ thing but this is important as Koji helps you visualize and create routes. This will save time down the road. Go check out the [Koji Docs](https://koji.vercel.app).

Now that you have configured the service go modify your **Golbat** and **Flygon** config files.

## Modify MITM client

Now that services are configured you need to configure devices to send data requests to the correct endpoint. Some MITM clients only allow one endpoint (Atlas) so Flygon can be used to receive all data and then forward the `/raw` data to Golbat.

- If sending data to Flygon use `http://YOUR_IP:9002/` (assuming default port).
- If sending data to Golbat you can use `http://YOUR_IP:9001/raw` (assuming default port).
