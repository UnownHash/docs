# Intro

There are two install paths, Docker or Standard. Both options provide an easy and supported way to build your environment. Docker is the recommended option as it is a little easier to get started with the only downside being the _"docker abstraction layer"_. Standard setup is much better if you plan on developing or testing pull requests, just be warned it is a lengthier setup process. Additionally, Standard requires extra steps when updating the services.
