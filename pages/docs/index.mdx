# Intro

There are two install paths, Docker or Standard. Both options provide an easy and supported way to build your environment. Docker is a little easier to get started, with the only downside being the _"docker abstraction layer"_. Standard setup is better if you plan on developing or testing pull requests. Just be warned, setup is a lengthier process.
