# Fletchling

[**Fletchling**](https://github.com/UnownHash/Fletchling) is a Golbat webhook receiver that processes pokemon webhooks and computes nesting pokemon.

## Features

- Receives and processes pokemon on the fly via webhook from Golbat.
- Uses global spawn data to not confuse event spawns (CD, Spotlight, etc) with nesting pokemon.
- No reliance on external sites for event or current nesting mon data.
- Tool for importing nests from overpass (fletchling-osm-importer).
- API to pull stats, purge stats, reload config, etc.


## Showcase

Below are examples of the end result in different applications.
