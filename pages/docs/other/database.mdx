# Database

To use the Unown# services, you will need a database server with two different databases configured. One for **Golbat** and one for **Flygon**.

## Supported

- MariaDB 10.6 or higher (recommended)
- MySQL 8 or higher

Sample service with docker:

```yml filename="docker-compose.yml"
version: '3.7'
services:
  db:
    image: mariadb:10.11
    command: --character-set-server=utf8mb4 --collation-server=utf8mb4_unicode_ci --default-authentication-plugin=mysql_native_password --binlog-expire-logs-seconds=86400
    container_name: db
    restart: unless-stopped
    environment:
    MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD: YourStrongRootPassw0rd!
    MYSQL_DATABASE: _temp
    MYSQL_USER: unownhash
    MYSQL_PASSWORD: YourStrongPassw0rd!
    ports:
      - 3306:3306
    volumes:
      - data:/var/lib/mysql
      #- /etc/localtime:/etc/localtime:ro
volumes:
  data:
    driver: local
```

Once the service is up, you will need to connect to the database service with [TablePlus](https://tableplus.com/), [Workbench](https://www.mysql.com/products/workbench/), Command Line, etc.

1. Create a database for flygon
1. Create a database for golbat

## Optimizing MariaDB

These options can help you quite significantly with performance.

```yml filename="my.cnf"
# This should be 50% of RAM, leaving space for golbat
innodb_buffer_pool_size = 64G

# Log file size should certainly be >= 1GB, but on a big system, this is more appropriate
innodb_log_file_size = 16G

# This should be the number of cores
innodb_read_io_threads = 10
innodb_write_io_threads = 10
innodb_purge_threads = 10

# Some people recommend at least 1 per gb, so could be increased above
innodb_buffer_pool_instances = 8

# allow big sorts, in memory temp tables
max_heap_table_size=256M

# extend wait timeout for locks to ensure a good chance to finish requests
innodb_lock_wait_timeout = 15

# logs are written once per second rather than after
innodb_flush_log_at_trx_commit = 0

# background tasks can work at high iops
innodb_io_capacity=1000

# Number of maximum available IOPS to background tasks
innodb_io_capacity_max=2000

# Trust disk system at the expense of recovery
innodb_doublewrite = 0
```
