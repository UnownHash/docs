# Hybrid Setup

<Callout type="warning" emoji="⚠️">
  This temporary solution will not be required once Flygon is released.
</Callout>

To use the Unown# stack for production purposes, you must supply some middleware to help split webhook requests between Golbat and RealDeviceMap. We will utilize [Nginx]'s mirror functionality to accomplish this task.

The result is data intended for controlling devices will go to `http://RDM:<port>/controler` while raw data goes to `http://RDM:<port>/raw` and `http://GOLBAT:<port>/raw`.

## Nginx Config File

Credit to [lenisko](https://github.com/jfberry/goforward/issues/1#issue-1528222766) for the original configuration.

```ini
# target of controler server
upstream controller {
    server RDM_IP_ADDRESS:9001;
}

# target of raw mirror one
upstream mirrorOne {
    server GOLBAT_IP_ADDRESS:9001;
}

# target of raw mirror two. If you need more /raw mirrors
# uncomment and add the same way as commented below
# upstream mirrorTwo {
#     server OTHER_IP_ADDRESS:9001;
# }

server {
        # listen port of nginx vhost
        listen 80;
        # server_name foobar.example.com;
        # access_log  off;
        # error_log   /dev/null   crit;

        location /raw {
                mirror                  /mirrorOne;
                #mirror                  /mirrorTwo;
                proxy_pass              http://controller/raw;
                proxy_connect_timeout   500ms;
                proxy_read_timeout      500ms;
                proxy_set_header        Host                            $host;
                client_body_buffer_size 10M;
        }

        location /controler {
                proxy_pass              http://controller/controler;
                proxy_connect_timeout   500ms;
                proxy_read_timeout      500ms;
                proxy_set_header        Host                            $host;
        }

        location = /mirrorOne {
                internal;
                proxy_pass              http://mirrorOne/raw;
                proxy_connect_timeout   500ms;
                proxy_read_timeout      500ms;
                proxy_set_header        Host                            $host;
                proxy_set_header        X-Goforward                     "Forwarded!";
        }

        #location = /mirrorTwo {

        #        proxy_read_timeout      500ms;
        #        proxy_set_header        Host                            $host;
        #        proxy_set_header        X-Goforward                     "Forwarded!";
        #}
}
```

## Manual Setup

1. Install [Nginx]
2. Copy the above configuration file into `/etc/nginx/confg.d/relay.conf`
3. Adjust the following variables for your environment

    - RDM_IP_ADDRESS:9001
    - GOLBAT_IP_ADDRESS:9001
    - Might need to adjust the listen port or server_name

4. Restart the nginx service `sudo systemctl restart nginx`
5. Adjust a few devices to send requests to this nginx endpoint
6. Monitor the access log located at `/var/log/nginx/access.log`
7. If everything works as intended, you will see `200` status messages in the access log.

_Note:_ You might want to turn off the `access_log` after verifying success to save on disk IO.

## Docker Setup

Docker configuration is almost the same as manual. If your Golbat & RDM instances are in docker, we recommend you include all three services in one `docker-compose.yml` file or make them all a part of one network. Sharing the same docker network allows services to communicate over their service name.

1. Copy the below contents and save it in a `docker-compose.yml` file

    ```yml
    version: '3'
    services:
    relay:
        image: nginx
        container_name: relay
        ports:
          - "8001:80"   # Right side is the external port
        volumes:
        - ./relay.conf:/etc/nginx/conf.d/default.conf
        logging:
        driver: "json-file"
        options:
            max-file: "5"
            max-size: "20m"

    networks:
    default:
        name: scanner
    ```

2. Copy the `nginx` configuration from the first section
3. Create a new file named `relay.conf` next to your `docker-compose.yml` file
4. Adjust the following variables for your environment. Remember, if all services are part of the same docker network, you can use their service name, and nginx will be able to resolve. IE - `rdm:9001`, `golbat:9001`, etc.

    - RDM_IP_ADDRESS:9001
    - GOLBAT_IP_ADDRESS:9001

5. Start the relay service with `docker compose up -d`
6. Monitor the logs `docker compose logs -f`
7. Adjust a few devices to send requests to this nginx endpoint
8. If everything works as intended, you will see `200` status messages in the access log.
