There are two methods to send data to Golbat while continuing to use the device controller component from RealDeviceMap (RDM). This will allow you take advantage of Golbat's parsing.

## Using RDM Raw Reflection

As of RealDeviceMap (RDM) version 1.51.0 (July 11, 2023) you can use the built-in `raw forward` option. Some notes:

- This only works with the json config option
- Disabling `application.process.pokemon` and `application.process.incident` are optional however they will save on disk IO
- When `application.process.pokemon` is disabled:
  - "Pokemon IV" instances will not function
  - RDM frontend will not display pokemon

Example configuration:

```json
{
  "application": {
    "rawForward": {
      "url": "http://yourGolbat:9001/raw",
      "bearer": "yourGolbatBearerSecret"
    },
    "process": {
      "pokemon": false,
      "incident": false
    },
  }
}
```
