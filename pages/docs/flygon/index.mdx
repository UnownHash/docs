[**Flygon**](https://github.com/UnownHash/Flygon) is our device controller. It receives HTTP requests from Man in the Middle (MITM) clients compatible with RealDeviceMap (RDM) and instructs clients on what to do. In short, it tells the game which accounts to log in with, where to go, and what action to take. Additionally, it can forward data requests to **Golbat** for data processing.

Currently, **Flygon** includes a proof of concept Pokemon scan mode. Right now, it's locked down to sponsors to gain feedback before releasing publicly. We are working on adding features and functionality as time allows. **No ETA** is provided, and we will release the product when we feel it is ready.

## Flygon-Admin

[**Flygon-Admin**](https://github.com/UnownHash/Flygon-Admin) is a web front end to interact with Flygon. Generally speaking, this is a "dumb" service, and if you have an enhancement, it needs to be implemented in **Flygon** first.

## Supported MITM clients

- [Atlas](https://pokemod.dev/) (Android)
- [Exeggcute/GC](https://jorgschulze73.github.io/gc-docs/) (iOS and Android)
