**Flygon** is our device controller. It receives HTTP requests from Man in the Middle (MITM) clients that are compatible with RealDeviceMap (RDM) and instructs clients what to do. In short it tells the game which account to login with, where to go, and what action to take. Additionally, it can forward data requests to **Golbat** for data processing.

Currently **Flygon** includes a proof of concept Pokemon scan mode. Right now it's locked down to sponsors to gain feedback prior to releasing publicly. We are working on adding features and functionality as time allows. **No ETA** is provided and we will release the product when we feel it is ready.

## [Flygon-Admin](https://github.com/UnownHash/Flygon-Admin)

**Flygon-Admin** is a web front end to interact with Flygon. Generally speaking this is a "dumb" service and if you have an enhancement it needs to be implemented in **Flygon** first.

## Supported MITM clients

- [Atlas](https://pokemod.dev/)
- GC (invite only)
- GDS (untested)
