# Welcome to Unownhash!

<Callout type="warning" emoji="⚠️">
  We are still in development stage as such there might be bugs and some
  features are **missing**.
</Callout>

We are a passionate group of developers working on a mapping project for Pokémon Go. We aren't finished yet but wanted to open things up to start getting feedback from the community!

## What is this?

- **Golbat** - is our data processor. It's primary purpose is to listen for events, format them into something useful, store to database, and send webhooks to external services.
- **Flygon** - is our device handler. Devices will reach out to this service to grab jobs, accounts, and routes.
- **Flygon-Admin** - this is our web frontend to manage the Flygon service.

## Features

Extremely customizable and highly optimized processing of game data. The services are written in the Go programming language which provides a great developer experience, excellent concurrency, great memory management, efficient, fast HTTP handling, and more. Additionally our design is using micro-services which allows for large flexibility, if you need to split services between multiple servers we have you covered.

Some of our highlighted features:

- Advanced Ditto detection
- Advanced IV, shiny, hundo, & nundo statistics
- Gym
- In Memory Pokemon Cache
- Invasions
- Pokemon
- Pokestop
- PVP calculation
- Quest
- Webhook
- and more!
