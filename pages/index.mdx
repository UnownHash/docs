# Welcome to Unown#

<Callout type="warning" emoji="⚠️">
  We are still in the development stage; there might be bugs, and some features are **missing**.
</Callout>

We are a passionate group of developers working on a mapping project for Pokémon Go. While just getting started, we wanted to open things up to start getting feedback from the community!

## Why did you make this?

We wanted to try something new, and the early results have been promising. The current tools in this space have been around for a few years. As such, they are stable, but increasingly difficult to add new features. Unown# allows us to re-think legacy ideas, rebuild from the ground up, and build a better user experience for all involved.

## What is this?

- **Golbat** - is our data processor. Its primary purpose is to listen for events, format them into something useful, store them in a database, and send webhooks to external services.
- **Flygon** - is our device handler. Devices will contact this service to grab jobs, accounts, and routes.
- **Flygon-Admin** - this is our web frontend to manage the Flygon service.

## Features

Each service is incredibly customizable and highly optimized. The services are written in the Go programming language, providing a great developer experience, excellent concurrency, great memory management, fast HTTP handling, and more. Additionally, our design uses micro-services which allows for significant flexibility. We have you covered if you need to split services between multiple servers.

Some of our highlighted features:

- Advanced Ditto detection
- Advanced IV, shiny, hundo, & nundo statistics
- Gym
- In Memory Pokemon Cache
- Invasions
- Pokemon
- Pokestop
- PVP calculation
- Quest
- Webhook
- and more!
